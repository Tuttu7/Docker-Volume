#### Docker Volume

- Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.
- In addition, volumes are often a better choice than persisting data in a container’s writable layer, because a volume does not increase the size of the containers using it, and the volume’s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.

#### Creating a Docker Volume 
````
[root@ip-172-31-14-145 ec2-user]# docker volume create myvolume
myvolume
[root@ip-172-31-14-145 ec2-user]# docker volume ls
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               myvolume
````
#### Putting some data in to the volume 

````
[root@ip-172-31-14-145 ec2-user]# docker run -it --name vol -v myvolume:/data alpine:3.8
/ # touch /data/test.txt
/ # touch /data/test5.txt
/ # exit
````
#### Attaching the newly created volume to another container 
````
[root@ip-172-31-14-145 ec2-user]# docker run -it --name vol1 -v myvolume:/data alpine:3.8
/ # ls -l /data
total 0
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root             0 Dec 27 09:54 test.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root             0 Dec 27 09:54 test5.txt
/ # exit
````
#### To get the details of the newly volume created

````
[root@ip-172-31-14-145 ec2-user]# docker volume inspect myvolume
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2019-12-27T09:54:18Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data",
        "Name": "myvolume",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
